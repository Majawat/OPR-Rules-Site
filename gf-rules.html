            Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive
            amongst the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
            war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector.
            Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over
            the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a
            Jumpgate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius
            Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of
            war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
            interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic
            engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes
            fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds,
            whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes
            to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
            massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark
            smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities,
            zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to
            foster their own grim ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
            carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising
            commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of
            the Sirius Sector.

          <p>
            Grimdark Future is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn sci-fi
            future, which is played using 32mm miniatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game mechanics are designed to be easy to learn but hard to
            master, bringing engaging sci-fi battles for new and experienced
            players alike.
          </p>
          <p>This rulebook is divided into 4 sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Rules</strong> - Everything you need to play the
              game, with plenty of diagrams and examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Rules</strong> - Extra rules that you can use on
              top of the basic rules to spice up the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Total Conversions</strong> - Rules that radically modify
              the base rules and provide a new experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional Content</strong> - Extra content that is
              available on our website, added here for your convenience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced
            rules first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game,
            you can then try out the total conversions, which provide a
            radically different experience from the base rules.

        <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
        <p>
          When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
          situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
          right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference
          to resolve the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use
          the following method in the interest of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of
          4-6 player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the
          match, and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer
          details of the rules
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that whenever possible, players should agree on any rules and
          unusual situations (such as weirdly shaped models) before the game
          begins, to avoid issues later.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
        <p>
          This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind,
          which are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes,
          and we recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they
          come with.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infantry:</strong> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Infantry:</strong> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bikes:</strong> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
          <li><strong>Monsters:</strong> 70mm tall on 60mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Walkers:</strong> 100mm tall on 120mm oval bases
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vehicles:</strong> Various sizes and not mounted on a base
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you
          keep base sizes consistent across all models.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Models & Units</h4>
        <p>
          In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
          groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all
          miniatures within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it
          only applies to one individual miniature
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
        <p>
          Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and
          what they can do.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name [Size]:</strong> The unit name and number of models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality:</strong> The score needed for attacks and morale.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The score needed for defense.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equipment:</strong> Any weapons and gear the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Rules:</strong> Any special rules the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> How many points it costs to take this unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Dice</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we
          will refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing
          with, we recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you
          can combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
          weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll
          them all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example
          D3, 2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation
          remains the same, so just apply the following explanations to all
          types of weird dice you come across.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>D3:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve
            the result, rounding up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2D6:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum
            the results of both dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>D6+1:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1
            to the result.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
          number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of
          the second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the
          first. A die roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many
          rules apply to it.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the
          rolloff must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player
          with the highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie
          the players must re-roll until there is a winner.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
        <p>
          During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to
          see if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its
          targets or passing morale tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one
          die. If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts
          as a success, else it counts as a fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
            player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that
            the model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the
            3).</em

      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Modifiers</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers
          to your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a
          unit's roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or
          subtract the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final
          result, however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1
          always counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified
          by.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with
            a -1 modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5,
            but because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.

        <h4>Weapons</h4>
        <p>
          All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: ranged
          weapons and melee weapons. Ranged weapons have a range value and can
          be used for shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value
          and can be used in melee.
        </p>
        <p>Weapons profiles are represented like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)</li>

        <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which
          you may use to measure distances at any time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When measuring the distance between two models you always measure
            from/to the closest point of their bases.
          </li>
          <li>
            When measuring the distance between two units you always measure
            from/to the closest model in each unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model
          has no base, then players must agree from where distances are to be
          measured (such as its hull/torso), and which unusual features may be
          ignored (like decorative banners or flame effects).

        <h4>Measuring Movement</h4>
        <p>
          When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of
          its base moves further than the total distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that these movement restrictions apply in the same way to models
          on bases of any shape or models without a base.

      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Line of Sight</h4>
        <p>
          When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model
          can see another model for any purpose. Simply get down to the eye
          level of the miniature, and check if it can see the target. If the
          target is visible, then it has line of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the
          miniature is actually facing, always have line of sight to themselves,
          and may always target themselves (unless stated otherwise). Models
          can't see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other
          units (friendly or enemy), but they can always see through friendly
          models from their own unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that for players may agree to ignore unusual features (like
          decorative banners or flame effects) for line of sight.

        <h4>Preparing the Battlefield</h4>
        <p>
          You are going to need a flat 6'x4' area to play on, which is usually
          referred to as “the battlefield" or “the table". Note that the game
          can be also played on smaller areas, as long as armies deploy at least
          24" apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we recommend playing on a table, you can of course play on the
          floor, on a bed, or wherever else you have space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have found a space to play, you are going to have to place at
          least 15 pieces of terrain on it, though we recommend using 20 or more
          to keep things interesting. Whilst it's always nice to play with great
          looking pieces of terrain, you can simply use household items such as
          books or cups as terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, but we
          have provided some general guidelines in the terrain section of this
          book to help you get started.

        <h4>Placing Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up
          D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first
          objective marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker
          each outside of the deployment zones, and over 9" away from other
          markers (note that markers can't be placed in unreachable positions,
          like impassable terrain or spots too tight to get to).
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>The Mission</h4>
        <p>
          At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3" of a marker whilst no
          enemies are, then it counts as being seized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Markers remain seized even if the unit moves away, but if units from
          both sides contest a marker at the end of a round, then it becomes
          neutral again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 rounds have been played, the game ends, and the player that
          controls most markers wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that unless stated otherwise, players don't ever win the game by
          fully destroying their opponent's army.

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>Preparing Your Army</h4>
        <p>
          Before the game begins, you and your opponent are going to have to
          agree on what size of game you want to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a start we recommend playing with armies worth 1000pts each, and
          once you have gotten familiar with the game, you can start playing
          full matches with 2000pts armies each.
        </p>
        <p>
          To put your army list together, simply select units and upgrades from
          one or more armies of your choice, and sum together their total point
          cost. There are no limitations as to how many units you can take, as
          long as their point cost doesn't go over the agreed total game size.
        </p>

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>Force Organisation (optional)</h4>
        <p>
          Optionally you and your opponent may agree to use the force
          organisation rules, which help make army composition more consistent
          and balanced.
        </p>
        <p>The armies must follow these limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only 1 hero per 500pts</li>
          <li>
            Only 1+X copies of the same unit, where X is 1 per 1000pts (combined
            units count as one)
          </li>
          <li>No single unit worth over 35% of total points</li>
          <li>Only 1 unit per 200pts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: When playing a 2000pts game, players may bring max. 4
            heroes, max. 3 copies of each unit, no unit worth over 700pts, and
            max. 10 units in total.

        <h4>Combined Units</h4>
        <p>
          When preparing your army, you may combine two copies of the same
          multi-model into a single big unit, as long as any upgrades that are
          applied to all models are bought for both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors with Rifles cannot be merged
            with a unit of Dynasty Warriors with Shotguns, because they have two
            different upgrades that are applied to all models in the unit.

          Once the mission has been set up, the players roll-off and the winner
          must start deploying their army first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The winning player first chooses one long table edge to deploy on and
          then places one unit fully within 12" of their table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they are done, then the opposing player places one unit fully
          within 12" of the opposite table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the players continue alternating in placing one unit each, until

        <h4>Rounds, Turns & Activations</h4>
        <p>
          The game is structured into game rounds, player turns and unit

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rounds:</strong> Each round is made up of multiple turns.

          <li>
            <strong>Turns:</strong> Each turn is made up of a single activation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Activations:</strong> Each activation is made up of an
            action.

      <article class="game-structure-item no-break">
        <h4>Game Structure</h4>
        <p>
          After both players have deployed their armies, the game starts with
          the first round and the player that won the deployment roll-off takes
          the first turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their turn, the player picks a unit that has not been activated
          yet, and activates it by performing an action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the action has been taken, their turn ends, and the opposing
          player's turn starts. This continues until all units have activated,
          at which point the round ends and a new one begins. On each new round
          the player that finished activating first on the last round gets to
          activate first.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 full rounds have been played the game ends, and players
          determine who won, by checking if they completed their mission
          objectives.

        <h4>Activating Units</h4>
        <p>
          Players must activate one unit that has not been activated yet and
          take one action.
        </p>
        <p>Here are all available actions and what they allow a unit to do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hold - </strong> Doesn't move, can shoot.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance - </strong> Advance - Moves 6" and can shoot after
            moving.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Rush - </strong> Moves 12" but can't shoot.</li>
          <li><strong>Charge - </strong> Moves 12" into melee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Models may never be within 1" of models from other units, unless they
          are taking a Charge action, and may never move through other models or
          units (friendly or enemy), even if they are taking a Charge action.
          Models may also never move outside of the battlefield (no part of
          them, at any point), or be placed in physically impossible locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that Advance, Rush, and Charge actions may sometimes be referred
          to as "Move Actions".

          the 1" distance restriction. Units may only take a Charge action if at
          least one model is within charge distance of the target unit
          (including any additional movement from special rules).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that Charge moves don't have to be in a straight line, and if
          being within charge distance becomes impossible (due to killed models,
          special rules, etc.), then the unit may complete its move in any
          direction and ends its activation.

        </p>
        <p>
          IIf a model is not in coherency with its unit at the beginning of its

        <p>
          When taking a Charge action, a unit must pick one valid target and all
          models in the unit must charge it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at least one model in the unit is within charge distance of one
          model from the target unit, and has a clear path to reach it, then
          that enemy is a valid target (no line of sight is needed).

      <article class="melee-item no-break">
        <h4>Charge Moves</h4>
        <p>
          Charging models must move by up to 12" to get into base contact with
          an enemy model from the target unit, or as close as possible, whilst
          still maintaining unit coherency (charge moves don't have to be in a
          straight line).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all charging models have moved, all models from the target unit
          that are not in base contact with a charging model must move by up to
          3" to get into base contact with a charging model, or as close as
          possible, maintaining unit coherency.

        <h4>Melee Resolution</h4>
        <p>
          Once the defender has struck back (or not if they chose not to strike
          back), you need to determine who won the melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sum the total number of wounds that each unit caused, and compare the
          two. If one unit caused more wounds than the other, then it counts as
          the winner, and the opposing unit must take a morale test. Note that
          in melee only the loser takes a morale test, regardless of casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the units are tied for how many wounds they caused, or neither unit
          caused any wounds, then the melee is a tie and neither unit must take
          a morale test.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if a unit didn't strike back in melee, then it must
          only take a morale test if it suffered at least one wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors charges a unit of Dwarves. The
            Dynasty Warriors inflict 2 wounds in that melee, whilst the Dwarves
            only inflict 1 wound. Since the Dynasty Warriors caused more wounds,
            the Dwarves have lost and must take a morale test.

          After determining who won the melee and taking morale tests, the units
          must make consolidation moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one of the two units was destroyed (by removing all models as
          casualties, or by routing due to a failed morale test), then the other
          unit may move by up to 3".
        </p>
        <p>
          If neither of the units was destroyed, then the charging unit must
          move back by 1" (if possible), to keep the separation between units
          clear, and show they are not locked in melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that players may agree not to separate units by 1" for
          simplicity, as long as they remember that units can still freely

          as dangerous terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a model moves in or through dangerous terrain, or is activated in
          it, then it must take a dangerous terrain test.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take a dangerous terrain test, roll one die (or as many dice as the
          model's Tough value), and if the result is 1, then the unit takes one
          automatic wound.

          Terrain features that are over 3" tall count as elevated terrain, and

        <h4>Terrain Setup Guidelines</h4>
        <p>
          Whilst there are no specific rules as to how terrain should be placed,
          here are some guidelines on how to handle terrain to have a balanced
          match.
        </p>
        <p>Here are all the things you should consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Size of your terrain</li>
          <li>Rules for each terrain</li>
          <li>Number of pieces</li>
          <li>How to place it</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="terrain-item no-break">
        <h4>Terrain Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Whilst there is no limit to the size of terrain that you can use for
          your games, we have a few recommendations for you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Small pieces of scatter terrain, like barrels, boxes, barricades,
            etc. should be somewhere between 1"x1" and 3"x3" in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large terrain features, like buildings, forests, lakes, etc. should
            be somewhere between 4"x4" and 8"x8" in size, but can be as large as
            12"x12".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For each terrain feature you'll also have to define some basic rules
          for how it works in the game. Most terrain features will probably have
          a single type, but you can combine multiple types together, and even
          add extra conditions to them
        </p>
        <p>Here are some guidelines for common terrain types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Barricades -</strong> Cover</li>
          <li><strong>Buildings -</strong> Impassable + Blocking</li>
          <li><strong>Fields -</strong> Difficult + Cover</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forests -</strong> Difficult + Cover + Units can see into
            and out of forests, but not through them
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hills -</strong> Cover + Difficult when moving up + Units on
            top may ignore one unit/terrain for line of sight
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lakes -</strong> Difficult (if shallow) or Impassable (if
            deep)
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lava -</strong> Dangerous</li>
          <li><strong>Mountains -</strong> Impassable + Blocking</li>
          <li><strong>Rivers - </strong>Dangerous when using rush/charge</li>
          <li><strong>Rubble -</strong> Difficult</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ruins -</strong> Cover + Dangerous when using rush/charge
          </li>
          <li><strong>Swamps -</strong> Difficult</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that whilst all of the terrain we mentioned so far is what you'll
          need for gameplay purposes, it's also always good to have elements of
          decorative terrain that have no effect on the game, but that help make
          your table look better.
        </p>
        <p>
          These could be elements such as patches of grass, shallow water
          puddles, scattered gravel, chain-link fences, street signs, and other
          things that make sense for your table.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="terrain-item no-break">
        <h4>Terrain Placement</h4>
        <p>
          When setting up terrain, you should use at least 15-20 pieces of
          terrain, although using more can be more interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple way to make sure that you're using enough terrain is to take
          as many pieces of terrain as you need to fully cover at least 25% of
          the table, and then spread them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also good to keep a balance of different terrain types, so that
          units with different weapons and special rules can use them
          effectively in various situations.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some basic terrain type recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At least 50% should block line of sight</li>
          <li>At least 33% should provide cover</li>
          <li>At least 33% should be difficult terrain</li>
          <li>Each player should pick 1 piece to be dangerous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: If you're playing with 12 pieces of terrain, at least 6
            should block line of sight, 4 should provide cover, 4 should be
            difficult terrain, and 2 should be dangerous terrain.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have chosen which terrain pieces you are going to use, you
          can either have one player set up all of the terrain, or have both
          players set up terrain together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure neither player has an advantage, you can roll-off, and
          then then alternate in placing one terrain piece each, starting with
          the player that won the roll-off.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, so we
          recommend trying to set up the table in such a way that it will
          provide a balanced playing field for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally you want to place enough blocking terrain that you can't draw
          clear line of sight from edge to edge across the table, as well as
          make sure that there are no gaps bigger than 12" between different
          terrain pieces. If you are playing with large units, we also recommend
          making sure that there are gaps of at least 6" between terrain, so
          they can fit through.

    <h4>Rules Priority & Stacking Effects</h4>
    <p>
      Most units have one or more special rules that affect the way they behave,
      and that sometimes go against the standard rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you come across one of these situations, the special rule always
      takes precedence over the standard rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that effects from multiple instances of the same special rule or
      spell don't stack, unless it is a rule with (X) in its name, or unless it
      is specified otherwise.

          terrain when moving and stopping, can't seize objectives, can't be
          charged, and units targeting it get -12" range and -1 to hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that whilst Aircraft models are flying above their ground, their
          base doesn't block movement or line of sight, and units may move and
          shoot under them. Only the actual model is used for purposes of
          blocking movement and line of sight.

            >Example: A Sniper targets a Hero that has Stealth, and is in a unit
            with Regeneration but not Stealth. Since the shooting is resolved as
            if the target was a unit of 1, the Sniper gets -1 to hit from
            Stealth, and the target doesn't get Regeneration.

          This model must take X wounds before being killed. If a model with
          tough joins a unit without it, then it is removed last when the unit
          takes wounds. Note that you must continue to put wounds on the tough
          model with most wounds in the unit until it is killed, before starting
          to put them on the next tough model (heroes must be assigned wounds
          last).

        <p><strong>Transport(X)</strong></p>
        <p>
          May transport up to X models or Heroes with up to Tough(6), and
          non-Heroes with up to Tough(3) which occupy 3 spaces each. Transports
          may deploy with units inside, and units may enter/exit by using any
          move action, but must stay fully within 6" of it when exiting. When a
          transport is destroyed, units inside must take a dangerous terrain
          test, are Shaken, and must be placed fully within 6" of the transport
          before removal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that units inside Transports are deployed at the same time as the
          Transport, and units can't both embark/disembark as part of the same
          activation. Units inside/outside of Transports don't have line of
          sight to the outside/inside, so they can't target each other for
          shooting, spells, etc. (but units inside can target other units
          inside, and the Transport itself). Units may use Charge actions to
          disembark, and they ignore the 1" move restriction when embarking
          (only one model needs to reach the Transport for everyone to embark).

          <em
            >Example: Regular models and Heroes with Tough(3) or Tough(6) occupy
            1 space, Tough(3) models occupy 3 spaces, and models with Tough(6)
            or higher can't be transported. This means that a unit of 10 regular
            models with a Tough(3) Hero occupy 11 spaces in total.
