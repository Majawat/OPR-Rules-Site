          Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive
          amongst the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
          war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector.
          Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over the
          horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a Jumpgate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius
          Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of
          war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
          interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic
          engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes fight
          bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.

          wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
          massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark
          smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities,
          zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to
          foster their own grim ambitions.

          the Sirius Sector.

        <p>
          Grimdark Future is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn sci-fi
          future, which is played using 32mm miniatures. The game mechanics are
          designed to be easy to learn but hard to master, pinging engaging
          sci-fi battles for new and experienced players alike. This rulebook is
          divided into 4 sections:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Basic Rules - Everything you need to play the game, with plenty of
            diagrams and examples.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advanced Rules - Extra rules that you can use on top of the basic
            rules to spice up the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Total Conversions - Rules that radically modify the base rules and
            provide a new experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additional Content - Extra content that is available on our website,
            added here for your convenience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced
          rules first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable
          with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game, you
          can then try out the total conversions, which provide a radically
          different experience from the base rules.

        <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
        <p>
          When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
          situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
          right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference
          to resolve the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use
          the following method in the interest of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of
          4 6 player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the
          match, and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer
          details of the rules.
        </p>
        <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
        <p>
          This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind,
          which are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes,
          and we recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they
          come with.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infantry:</strong> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Infantry:</strong> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bikes:</strong> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
          <li><strong>Monsters:</strong> 70mm tall on 60mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Walkers:</strong> 100mm tall on 120mm oval bases
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vehicles:</strong> Various sizes and not mounted on a base
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you
          keep base sizes consistent across all models.
        </p>
        <h4>Models & Units</h4>
        <p>
          In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
          groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all
          miniatures within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it
          only applies to one individual miniature.
        </p>
        <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
        <p>
          Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and
          what they can do.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name (Size):</strong> The unit name and number of models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality:</strong> The score needed for attacks and morale.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The score needed for defense.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equipment:</strong> Any weapons and gear the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Rules:</strong> Any special rules the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> How many points it costs to take this unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Dice</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we
          will refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing
          with, we recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you
          can combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
          weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll
          them all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example
          D3, 2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation
          remains the same, so just apply the following explanations to all
          types of weird dice you come across.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>D3:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve
            the result, rounding up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2D6:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum
            the results of both dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>D6+1:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1
            to the result.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
          number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of
          the second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the
          first. A die roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many
          rules apply to it.
        </p>
        <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the
          roll off must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player
          with the highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie
          the players must re-roll until there is a winner.
        </p>
        <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
        <p>
          During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to
          see if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its
          targets or passing morale tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one
          die. If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts
          as a success, else it counts as a fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
            player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that
            the model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the
            3).</em
          >
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Modifiers</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers
          to your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a
          unit's roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or
          subtract the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final
          result, however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1
          always counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified
          by.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with
            a -1 modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5,
            but because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Weapons</h4>
        <p>
          All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: ranged
          weapons and melee weapons. Ranged weapons have a range value and can
          be used for shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value
          and can be used in melee.
        </p>
        <p>Weapons profiles are represented like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Example: Heavy Rifle (24", A1, AP(1))</em></p>
        <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which
          you may use to measure distances at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model
          has no base, then all distances are measured from its hull or torso,
          depending on the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          When measuring the distance between two models you always measure
          from/to the closest point of their bases.
        </p>
        <p>
          When measuring the distance between two units you always measure
          from/to the closest model in each unit.
        </p>

          width="370"
          height="auto"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Measuring Movement</h4>
        <p>
          When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of
          its base moves further than the total distance.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/gf-images/measuring-movement.png"
          alt="showing incorrect and correct measurement of movement"
          width="370"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          Note that whilst all examples here show round bases, these movement
          restrictions apply in the same way to models on bases of different
          shape or models without a base.
        </p>
        <h4>Line of Sight (LOS)</h4>
        <p>
          When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model
          can see another model for any purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how strict players want to be with line of sight, they
          need to agree on using one of the following methods before the game
          begins:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic Line of Sight (aka True LoS)</li>
          <li>Top-Down Line of Sight (aka 2D LoS)</li>
          <li>Volumetric Line of Sight (aka 3D LoS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each one of these methods is more complex than the other, and we
          recommend playing with basic line of sight for your first match, and
          only switch to another more complex method if you find it not to be
          precise enough for your needs.

        <p>
          Note that no matter which method you use, the following rules always
          apply to line of sight:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the
            miniature is actually facing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the
            purpose of line of sight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter
            of other units (both friendly or enemy units).
          </li>
          <li>
            Models always have line of sight to themselves, and may target
            themselves (unless stated otherwise).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Basic Line of Sight (aka True LOS)</h4>
        <p>
          When playing with basic line of sight, models can see targets based on
          the actual line of sight of the physical miniature.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine line of sight, simply get down to the eye level of the
          miniature, and check if it can see the target. If the target is
          visible, then the model has line of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using this method, we recommend that models should see at least
          10% of the target in order to have line of sight, to avoid discussions
          over ambiguous edge cases.
        </p>
        <h4>Top-Down Line of Sight (aka 2D LOS)</h4>
        <p>
          When playing with top-down line of sight, models can see targets by
          drawing lines between their bases, and obstructions block sight based
          on their assigned height.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the game begins, players must assign a height value to all
          units and terrain. As a guideline, height can be defined as a value of
          X+1, where X is the actual height of the physical item.
        </p>
        <p><em> Example: A 2" high building counts as being height 3. </em></p>
        <p>
          The same guidelines apply to models, but you can also use the
          following pre-set heights to speed up preparation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Height 1 - Swarms</li>
          <li>Height 2 - Infantry, Artillery</li>
          <li>Height 3 - Large Infantry, Cavalry, Chariots</li>
          <li>Height 4 - Large Cavalry, Monsters, Vehicles</li>
          <li>Height 5 - Large Monsters, Giants</li>
          <li>Height 6 - Titans</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When standing on top of terrain, units add its height to their own,
          and the total counts as their new height value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Example: A height 2 infantry models standing on a height 3 building
            counts as being height 5.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine line of sight, simply draw a straight line from any point
          of the model's base to any point of the target's base. If the line
          doesn't pass through any obstacles or units of same height or higher
          than both models, then the model has line of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using this method, we recommend counting all models and terrain
          pieces of the same type as being the same height, to avoid having to
          constantly have to measure heights.
        </p>

          height="auto"
        />
        <h4>Volumetric Line of Sight (aka 3D LOS)</h4>
        <p>
          When playing with volumetric line of sight, models can see targets by
          drawing lines between imaginary volumes, with heights defined by their
          base sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the game begins, players must assign a height value in inches
          to all units. Each model occupies a volume of space of that height
          above its base, determined by its base size. As a guideline, height
          can be defined based on the typical size of models that are mounted on
          those base types.
        </p>
        <p>
          For models without a base, measure their actual height and define an
          area around their centre as being their base size for determining how
          large their volume is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst not an exhaustive list, here are some pre-set heights you can
          use to speed up preparation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>25mm Base - Height 1"</li>
          <li>32mm Base - Height 1.25"</li>
          <li>40mm Base - Height 1.5"</li>
          <li>50mm Base - Height 2"</li>
          <li>60mm Base - Height 3"</li>
          <li>100mm Base - Height 4"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To determine line of sight, simply draw a straight line from any point
          of the model's volume to any point of the target model's volume. If
          the line doesn't pass through any obstacles or unit volumes, then the
          model has line of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using this method, we recommend building simple paper cylinders
          with the volume of each base size before playing, which can be used
          during the game in place of models to determine line of sight more
          easily.

      <div class="column">
        <h4>Preparing the Battlefield</h4>
        <p>
          You are going to need a flat 6'x4' area to play on, which is usually
          referred to as “the battlefield" or “the table". Note that the game
          can be also played on smaller areas, as long as armies deploy at least
          24" apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we recommend playing on a table, you can of course play on the
          floor, on a bed, or wherever else you have space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have found a space to play, you are going to have to place at
          least 15 pieces of terrain on it, though we recommend using 20 or more
          to keep things interesting. Whilst it's always nice to play with great
          looking pieces of terrain, you can simply use household items such as
          books or cups as terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, but we
          have provided some general guidelines in the terrain section of this
          book to help you get started.
        </p>
        <h4>Placing Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up
          D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first
          objective marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker
          each outside of the deployment zones, and over 9" away from other
          markers (note that markers can't be placed in unreachable position,
          like impassable terrain).
        </p>
        <h4>The Mission</h4>
        <p>
          At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3" of a marker whilst no
          enemies are, then it counts as being seized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Markers remain seized even if the unit moves away, but if units from
          both sides contest a marker at the end of a round, then it becomes
          neutral again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 rounds have been played, the game ends, and the player that
          controls most markers wins.
        </p>
        <h4>Preparing Your Army</h4>
        <p>
          Before the game begins, you and your opponent are going to have to
          agree on what size of game you want to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a start we recommend playing with armies worth 1000pts each, and
          once you have gotten familiar with the game, you can start playing
          full matches with 2000pts armies each.
        </p>
        <p>
          To put your army together, simply select units and upgrades from your
          army's list, and sum together their total point cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no limitations as to how many units you can take, as long as
          their total point cost doesn't go over the agreed limit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Force Organisation <small>(optional)</small></h4>
        <p>
          Optionally you and your opponent may agree to use the force
          organisation rules, which help make army composition more consistent
          and balanced.
        </p>
        <p>The armies must follow these limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only 1 hero per 500pts</li>
          <li>
            Only 1+X copies of the same unit, where X is 1 per 1000pts (combined
            units count as one)
          </li>
          <li>No single unit worth over 35% of total points</li>
          <li>Only 1 unit per 200pts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: When playing a 2000pts game, players may bring max. 4
            heroes, max. 3 copies of each unit, no unit worth over 700pts, and
            max. 10 units in total.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Combined Units</h4>
        <p>
          When preparing your army, you may combine two copies of the same
          multi-model into a single big unit, as long as any upgrades that are
          applied to all models are bought for both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors with Rifles cannot be merged
            with a unit of Dynasty Warriors with Shotguns, because they have two
            different upgrades that are applied to all models in the unit.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Deploying Armies</h4>
        <p>
          Once the mission has been set up, the players roll-off and the winner
          must start deploying their army first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The winning player first chooses one long table edge to deploy on and
          then places one unit fully within 12" of their table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they are done, then the opposing player places one unit fully
          within 12" of the opposite table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the players continue alternating in placing one unit each, until
          all units have been deployed.

    <hr />
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Rounds, Turns and Activations</h4>
        <p>
          The game is structured into game rounds, player turns and unit
          activations. Here is the breakdown of what these mean:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rounds:</strong> Each round is made up of multiple turns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Turns:</strong> Each turn is made up of a single activation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Activations:</strong> Each activation is made up of an
            action.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Game Structure</h4>
        <p>
          After both players have deployed their armies, the game starts with
          the first round and the player that won the deployment roll-off takes
          the first turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their turn, the player picks a unit that has not been activated
          yet, and activates it by performing an action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the action has been taken, their turn ends, and the opposing
          player's turn starts. This continues until all units have activated,
          at which point the round ends and a new one begins. On each new round
          the player that finished activating first on the last round gets to
          activate first.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 full rounds have been played the game ends, and players
          determine who won, by checking if they completed their mission
          objectives.
        </p>
        <h4>Activating Units</h4>
        <p>
          Players must activate one unit that has not been activated yet and
          take one action.
        </p>
        <p>Here are all available actions and what they allow a unit to do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hold - </strong> Doesn't move, can shoot.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance - </strong> Advance - Moves 6" and can shoot after
            moving.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Rush - </strong> Moves 12" but can't shoot.</li>
          <li><strong>Charge - </strong> Moves 12" into melee.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Holding</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Hold action, the models in the unit may not move or turn
          in any direction.
        </p>
        <h4>Advancing</h4>
        <p>
          When taking an Advance action, all models in the unit may move by up
          to 6". Models may move and turn in any direction regardless of their
          facing, as long as no part of their bases move further than the total
          movement distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models may not move within 1" of models from other units (friendly or
          enemy), unless they are taking a Charge action. Note that models may
          never move through other models or units, even if they are taking a
          Charge action.
        </p>
        <h4>Rushing</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Rush action, all models in the unit may move by up to
          12". The same rules about turning, facing and keeping 1" distance
          apply to Rush actions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Charging (+ Assaults)</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Charge action, all models in the unit may move by up to
          12". Models taking a Charge action may ignore the 1" distance
          restriction, however since this is a little more complex it will be
          explained in detail in the Melee section.
        </p>
        <p>
          When declaring a Charge action, units may choose to assault, allowing
          them to shoot before moving. When assaulting, units get -1 to hit when
          shooting and striking, and halve their move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that units may only take a Charge action if their move would
          bring at least one model into base contact with another model from the
          target unit. Also, if the target is killed before the charging unit
          has reached base contact, then the unit may complete its remaining
          movement and then end its activation.
        </p>
        <h4>Unit Coherency</h4>
        <p>
          All models in a unit must always stay within 1" of at least one other
          model, and must stay within 9" of all other models (or as close as
          possible), forming an uninterrupted chain of models in 1" coherency
          with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a model is not in coherency with its unit at the beginning of its
          activation, then you must take an action so that the model gets back
          into coherency.
        </p>

        <h4>Picking Targets</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Shooting action, a unit must pick one valid target and
          all models in the unit may shoot at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at least one model in the unit has line of sight to an enemy model,
          and has a weapon that is within range of that model, then that enemy
          is a valid target.
        </p>
        <h4>Who Can Shoot</h4>
        <p>
          All models in a unit with line of sight to the target, and that have a
          weapon that is within range of it, may fire at it. Note that models
          may always ignore friendly models from their own unit when determining
          line of sight.
        </p>

            the Dwarves. The model at the top is in range but has no line of

            of range.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Multiple Weapon Types</h4>
        <p>
          If a unit is firing multiple weapon types, then you may separate each
          weapon type into its own weapon group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each group may be fired at a different target, however you may fire
          only at up to two different targets, and all weapons from the same
          group must fire at the same target.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the target for each weapon group must be declared before
          rolling, and all weapons are fired simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors is armed with Rifles and a
            Plasma Rifle. Since they have two weapon types, the Dynasty Warriors
            can fire all the Rifles at a nearby Dwarf squad, and the Plasma
            Rifle at a distant Powersuit Guard.

        <p>
          Sum the Attack value from the weapons of all models that can shoot at

          the target.

        <h4>Picking Targets</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Charge action, a unit must pick one valid target and all
          models in the unit must charge it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at least one model in the unit is within charge distance of one
          model from the target unit, and has a clear path to reach it, then
          that enemy is a valid target (no line of sight is needed).
        </p>
        <h4>Charge Moves</h4>
        <p>
          Charging models must move by up to 12" to get into base contact with
          an enemy model from the target unit, or as close as possible, whilst
          still maintaining unit coherency (charge moves don't have to be in a
          straight line).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all charging models have moved, all models from the target unit
          that are not in base contact with a charging model must move by up to
          3" to get into base contact with a charging model, or as close as
          possible, maintaining unit coherency.
        </p>

        <h4>Who Can Strike</h4>
        <p>
          All models in a unit that are in base contact with an enemy model from
          the target unit, or that are within 2" of a model from the target
          unit, may attack it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models may strike with all of their melee weapons, and may only strike
          at models from the target unit.

        <h4>The Melee Sequence</h4>
        <p>
          Melee is done in a simple sequence which has to be followed separately
          for the charging unit and the target unit:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Determine Attacks</li>
          <li>Roll to Hit</li>

        </ol>
        <h4>1. Determine Attacks</h4>
        <p>
          Sum the Attack value from the weapons of all models that can strike at
          the target to determine how many attacks the unit has in total for
          this melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em

            Dwarves. Three of the Dynasty Warriors armed with CCWs (Attack 1)

            attacks for this melee.

          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>3. Roll to Block</h4>
        <p>
          For every hit that the unit has taken, the defending player must roll
          one die, trying to score the target's Defense value. Each success
          counts as a blocked hit, and all failed rolls cause one wound each to
          the target.

          <em
            >Example: The unit of Dwarves (Defense 4+) has taken two hits. They

        <p>
          For each wound that the unit has taken, the defending player must
          remove one model as a casualty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The defending player may remove models from the target in any order,
          keeping unit coherency in mind.
        </p>
        <h4>Return Strikes</h4>
        <p>
          Once all charging models have attacked, the defending unit may choose
          to strike back (following the melee sequence again), but doesn't have
          to. Note that striking back does not count as its activation, and
          activated units may strike back.
        </p>
        <h4>Fatigue</h4>
        <p>
          After attacking in melee for the first time during a round, either by
          charging or by striking back, models only hit on unmodified rolls of 6
          in melee until the end of that round.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Melee Resolution</h4>
        <p>
          Once the defender has struck back (or not if they chose not to strike
          back), you need to determine who won the melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sum the total number of wounds that each unit caused, and compare the
          two. If one unit caused more wounds than the other, then it counts as
          the winner, and the opposing unit must take a morale test. Note that
          in melee only the loser takes a morale test, regardless of casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the units are tied for how many wounds they caused, or neither unit
          caused any wounds, then the melee is a tie and neither unit must take
          a morale test.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if a unit didn't strike back in melee, then it must
          only take a morale test if it suffered at least one wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors charges a unit of Dwarves. The
            Dynasty Warriors inflict 2 wounds in that melee, whilst the Dwarves
            only inflict 1 wound. Since the Dynasty Warriors caused more wounds,
            the Dwarves have lost and must take a morale test.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Consolidation Moves</h4>
        <p>
          After determining who won the melee and taking morale tests, the units
          must make consolidation moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one of the two units was destroyed (by removing all models as
          casualties, or by routing due to a failed morale test), then the other
          unit may move by up to 3".
        </p>
        <p>
          If neither of the units was destroyed, then the charging unit must
          move back by 1" (if possible), to keep the separation between units
          clear, and show they are not locked in melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that players may agree not to separate units by 1" for
          simplicity, as long as they remember that units can still freely
          activate, move, shoot, charge, etc. despite being in contact.
        </p>
        <h4>Morale & When to Test</h4>
        <p>
          As units take casualties, they will be pinned by enemy fire or flee
          from the battlefield entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of an activation in which a unit takes wounds that leave it
          with half or less of its starting size or tough value (for units with
          a single model), or whenever it loses a melee combat, then it must
          take a morale test.
        </p>
        <p>Note that starting size is counted at the beginning of the game.</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors shoots at a unit of Dwarves
            that started the game with 10 models, and manages to kill 5. Since
            half of the Dwarves were killed, the unit must take a morale test.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Taking Morale Tests</h4>
        <p>
          To take a morale test, the affected unit must simply take one regular
          Quality test, and see what happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the roll is successful, nothing happens.</li>
          <li>If the roll is unsuccessful, the unit is Shaken.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Melee Morale Tests</h4>
        <p>
          Units that were in melee don't take morale tests from wounds at the
          end of an activation, but must compare the number of wounds each unit
          caused instead. The unit with the lowest total loses, and must take a
          morale test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that units that are destroyed in melee always count as having
          lost, and their opponent doesn't have to take a morale test, even if
          it dealt less wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take a morale test, the affected unit must simply take one regular
          Quality test, and see what happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the roll is successful, nothing happens.</li>
          <li>
            If the roll is unsuccessful, and the unit still has over half or
            more of its starting size or tough value (for units with a single
            model), then the unit is Shaken.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the roll is unsuccessful, and the unit only has half or less of
            its starting size or tough value (for units with a single model),
            then the unit Routs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Shaken Units</h4>
        <p>
          Shaken units get -1 to Quality and Defense rolls, halve their
          movement, and can't seize objective markers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When activated, Shaken units may spend their activation being idle and
          doing nothing, which stops them from being Shaken at the end of their
          activation.
        </p>
        <h4>Routed Units</h4>
        <p>
          Routed units have lost all hope and are taken captive, flee the
          battle, or are otherwise rendered ineffective.
        </p>
        <p>Simply remove the entire unit from the game as a casualty.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h4>Terrain Rules</h4>
        <p>
          When setting up terrain, players must agree on what terrain type rules
          each piece of terrain follows. This will make sure that you do not
          have any arguments during your game, and that things can proceed
          smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each piece of terrain may count as having multiple terrain types, and
          you may also add other conditions to further customize your terrain
          rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A piece of Forest terrain could count both as Cover as
            well as Difficult Terrain. Additionally, you could allow units to
            shoot into and out of it freely, but not through it.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Open Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Grass Fields, Dirt Roads, Streets, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Any surface that is not specifically defined as a type of terrain
          (like forests, buildings, rivers, etc.) counts as open terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open terrain does not have any special rules, and any rules that
          affect terrain do not apply to open terrain.
        </p>
        <h4>Impassable Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Mountains, Canyons, Deep Water, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Any surface that would stop models from moving through it counts as
          impassable terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Units may not move through impassable terrain, unless they have any
          rules that allow them to ignore it.
        </p>
        <h4>Blocking Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Walls, Buildings, Rocks, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Any piece of terrain that models can't see or shoot through counts as
          blocking terrain.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          Units may not draw line of sight through blocking terrain, unless they
          have any rules that allow them to ignore it.
        </p>
        <h4>Cover Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Forests, Ruins, Sandbags, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Terrain features that models can hide in or behind, or that could stop
          projectiles, count as cover terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the majority of models in a unit are in or behind a piece of cover
          terrain, they get +1 to Defense rolls when blocking hits from shooting
          attacks.
        </p>
        <h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Woods, Mud, Rivers, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Terrain features that hinder a model's movement, or force them to slow
          down, count as difficult terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any model in a unit moves in or through difficult terrain at any
          point of its move, then all models in the unit may not move more than
          6" for that movement.
        </p>
        <h4>Dangerous Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Examples: Quicksand, Razor Wire, Mine Fields, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Terrain features that could harm models, or outright kill them, count
          as dangerous terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a model moves in or through dangerous terrain, or is activated in
          it, then it must take a dangerous terrain test.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take a dangerous terrain test, roll one die (or as many dice as the
          model's Tough value), and if the result is 1, then the unit takes one
          automatic wound.
        </p>
        <h4>Elevated Terrain</h4>
        <p><em>Hills, Rooftops, Cliffs, etc. </em></p>
        <p>
          Terrain that is over 3" tall, and any gaps that are over 1" wide,
          count as elevated terrain, and are impassable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any terrain piece that is up to 3" tall can be climbed as part of a
          unit's regular movement, and units may move across gaps up to 1" wide
          as if they were solid ground.

        <p>
          Whilst there is no limit to the size of terrain that you can use for
          your games, we have a few recommendations for you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Small pieces of scatter terrain, like barrels, boxes, barricades,
            etc. should be somewhere between 1"x1" and 3"x3" in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large terrain features, like buildings, forests, lakes, etc. should
            be somewhere between 4”x4” and 8”x8” in size, but can be as large as
            12”x12”.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For each terrain feature you'll also have to define some basic rules
          for how it works in the game. Most terrain features will probably have
          a single type, but you can combine multiple types together, and even
          add extra conditions to them.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some guidelines for common terrain types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Barricades -</strong> Cover</li>
          <li><strong>Buildings -</strong> Impassable + Blocking</li>
          <li><strong>Fields -</strong> Difficult + Cover</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forests -</strong> Difficult + Cover + Units can see into
            and out of forests, but not through them
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hills -</strong> Cover + Difficult when moving up + Units on
            top may ignore one unit/terrain for line of sight
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lakes -</strong> Difficult (if shallow) or Impassable (if
            deep)
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lava -</strong> Dangerous</li>
          <li><strong>Mountains -</strong> Impassable + Blocking</li>
          <li><strong>Rivers - </strong>Dangerous when using rush/charge</li>
          <li><strong>Rubble -</strong> Difficult</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ruins -</strong> Cover + Dangerous when using rush/charge
          </li>
          <li><strong>Swamps -</strong> Difficult</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that whilst all of the terrain we mentioned so far is what you'll
          need for gameplay purposes, it's also always good to have elements of
          decorative terrain that have no effect on the game, but that help make
          your table look better.
        </p>
        <p>
          These could be elements such as patches of grass, shallow water
          puddles, scattered gravel, chain-link fences, street signs, and other
          things that make sense for your table.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h4>Terrain Placement</h4>
        <p>
          When setting up terrain, you should use at least 10-15 pieces of
          terrain, although using more can be more ineresting.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple way to make sure that you're using enough terrain is to take
          as many pieces of terrain as you need to fully cover at least 25% of
          the table, and then spread them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also good to keep a balance of different terrain types, so that
          units with different weapons and special rules can use them
          effectively in various situations.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some basic terrain type recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At least 50% should block line of sight</li>
          <li>At least 33% should provide cover</li>
          <li>At least 33% should be difficult terrain</li>
          <li>Each player should pick 1 piece to be dangerous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: If you're playing with 12 pieces of terrain, at least 6
            should block line of sight, 4 should provide cover, 4 should be
            difficult terrain, and 2 should be dangerous terrain.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have chosen which terrain pieces you are going to use, you
          can either have one player set up all of the terrain, or have both
          players set up terrain together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure neither player has an advantage, you can roll-off, and
          then then alternate in placing one terrain piece each, starting with
          the player that won the roll-off.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, so we
          recommend trying to set up the table in such a way that it will
          provide a balanced playing field for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally you want to place enough blocking terrain that you can’t draw
          clear line of sight from edge to edge across the table, as well as
          make sure that there are no gaps bigger than 12” between different
          terrain pieces. If you are playing with large units, we also recommend
          making sure that there are gaps of at least 6” between terrain, so
          they can fit through.

    <h3><a name="special-rules">Special Rules</a></h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Rules Priority & Stacking Effects</h4>
    <p>
      Most units have one or more special rules that affect the way they behave,
      and that sometimes go against the standard rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you come across one of these situations, the special rule always
      takes precedence over the standard rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that effects from multiple instances of the same special rule or
      spell don't stack, unless it is a rule with (X) in its name, or unless it
      is specified otherwise.
