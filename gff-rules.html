            Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive
            amongst the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
            war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector.
            Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over
            the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a
            Jumpgate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius
            Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of
            war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
            interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic
            engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes
            fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds,
            whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes
            to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
            massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark
            smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities,
            zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to
            foster their own grim ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
            carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising
            commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of
            the Sirius Sector.

          <p>
            Grimdark Future: Firefight is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn
            sci-fi future, which is played using 32mm miniatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game mechanics are designed to be easy to learn but hard to
            master, bringing engaging sci-fi battles for new and experienced
            players alike.
          </p>
          <p>This rulebook is divided into 4 sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Rules</strong> - Everything you need to play the
              game, with plenty of diagrams and examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Rules</strong> - Extra rules that you can use on
              top of the basic rules to spice up the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Total Conversions</strong> - Rules that radically modify
              the base rules and provide a new experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional Content</strong> - Extra content that is
              available on our website, added here for your convenience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced
            rules first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game,
            you can then try out the total conversions, which provide a
            radically different experience from the base rules.

        <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
        <p>
          When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
          situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
          right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference
          to resolve the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use
          the following method in the interest of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of
          4-6 player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the
          match, and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer
          details of the rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that whenever possible, players should agree on any rules and
          unusual situations (such as weirdly shaped models) before the game
          begins, to avoid issues later.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
        <p>
          This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind,
          which are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes,
          and we recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they
          come with.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infantry:</strong> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Infantry:</strong> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bikes:</strong> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you
          keep base sizes consistent across all models.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Models & Units</h4>
        <p>
          In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
          groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all
          miniatures within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it
          only applies to one individual miniature.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
        <p>
          Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and
          what they can do.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name [Size]:</strong> The unit name and number of models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality:</strong> The score needed for attacks and morale.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The score needed for defense.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equipment:</strong> Any weapons and gear the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Rules:</strong> Any special rules the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> How many points it costs to take this unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Dice</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we
          will refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing
          with, we recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you
          can combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
          weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll
          them all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example
          D3, 2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation
          remains the same, so just apply the following explanations to all
          types of weird dice you come across.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>D3:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve
            the result, rounding up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2D6:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum
            the results of both dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>D6+1:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1
            to the result.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
          number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of
          the second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the
          first. A die roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many
          rules apply to it.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the
          rolloff must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player
          with the highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie
          the players must re-roll until there is a winner.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
        <p>
          During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to
          see if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its
          targets or passing morale tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one
          die. If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts
          as a success, else it counts as a fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
            player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that
            the model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the
            3).</em

      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Modifiers</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers
          to your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a
          unit's roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or
          subtract the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final
          result, however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1
          always counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified
          by.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with
            a -1 modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5,
            but because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.
          </em>
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Weapons</h4>
        <p>
          All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: ranged
          weapons and melee weapons. Ranged weapons have a range value and can
          be used for shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value
          and can be used in melee.
        </p>
        <p>Weapons profiles are represented like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which
          you may use to measure distances at any time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When measuring the distance between two models you always measure
            from/to the closest point of their bases.
          </li>
          <li>
            When measuring the distance between two units you always measure
            from/to the closest model in each unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model
          has no base, then players must agree from where distances are to be
          measured (such as its hull/torso), and which unusual features may be
          ignored (like decorative banners or flame effects).

        <h4>Measuring Movement</h4>
        <p>
          When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of
          its base moves further than the total distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that these movement restrictions apply in the same way to models
          on bases of any shape or models without a base.

      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Line of Sight</h4>
        <p>
          When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model
          can see another model for any purpose. Simply get down to the eye
          level of the miniature, and check if it can see the target. If the
          target is visible, then it has line of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the
          miniature is actually facing, always have line of sight to themselves,
          and may always target themselves (unless stated otherwise). Models
          can't see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other
          units (friendly or enemy), but they can always see through friendly
          models from their own unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that for players may agree to ignore unusual features (like
          decorative banners or flame effects) for line of sight.

        <h4>Preparing the Battlefield</h4>
        <p>
          You are going to need a flat 4'x4' area to play on, which is usually
          referred to as "the battlefield" or "the table". Note that the game
          can be also played on smaller areas, as long as armies deploy at least
          24" apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we recommend playing on a table, you can of course play on the
          floor, on a bed, or wherever else you have space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have found a space to play, you are going to have to place at
          least 20 pieces of terrain on it, though we recommend using 25 or more
          to keep things interesting. Whilst it's always nice to play with great
          looking pieces of terrain, you can simply use household items such as
          books or cups as terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, but we
          have provided some general guidelines in the terrain section of this
          book to help you get started.

        <h4>Placing Objectives</h4>
        <p>
          After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up
          D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first
          objective marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker
          each outside of the deployment zones, and over 9" away from other
          markers (note that markers can't be placed in unreachable positions,
          like impassable terrain or spots too tight to get to).
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>The Mission</h4>
        <p>
          At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3" of a marker whilst no
          enemies are, then it counts as being seized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Markers remain seized even if the unit moves away, but if units from
          both sides contest a marker at the end of a round, then it becomes
          neutral again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 rounds have been played, the game ends, and the player that
          controls most markers wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that unless stated otherwise, players don't ever win the game by
          fully destroying their opponent's army.

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>Preparing Your Army</h4>
        <p>
          Before the game begins, you and your opponent are going to have to
          agree on what size of game you want to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a start we recommend playing with armies worth 200pts each, and
          once you have gotten familiar with the game, you can start playing
          full matches with 300pts armies each.
        </p>
        <p>
          To put your army list together, simply select units and upgrades from
          one or more armies of your choice, and sum together their total point
          cost. There are no limitations as to how many units you can take, as
          long as their point cost doesn't go over the agreed total game size.

      <article class="preparation-item no-break">
        <h4>Force Organisation (optional)</h4>
        <p>
          Optionally you and your opponent may agree to use the force
          organisation rules, which help make army composition more consistent
          and balanced.
        </p>
        <p>The armies must follow these limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only 1 hero per 150pts</li>
          <li>
            Only 1+X copies of the same unit, where X is 1 per 150pts (combined
            units count as one)
          </li>
          <li>No single unit worth over 35% of total points</li>
          <li>Only 1 unit per 30pts</li>
          <li>Only 1 model per 20pts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: When playing a 300pts game, players may bring max. 2
            heroes, max. 3 copies of each unit, no unit worth over 105pts, max.
            10 units in total, and max. 15 models in total.

          must start deploying their army first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The winning player first chooses one long table edge to deploy on and
          then places one unit fully within 12" of their table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they are done, then the opposing player places one unit fully
          within 12" of the opposite table edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the players continue alternating in placing one unit each, until

        <h4>Game Structure</h4>
        <p>
          The game is structured into game rounds, player turns and unit
          activations. Here is the breakdown of what these mean:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rounds:</strong> Each round is made up of multiple turns.

          <li>
            <strong>Turns:</strong> Each turn is made up of a single activation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Activations:</strong> Each activation is made up of an
            action.

      </article>
      <article class="game-structure-item no-break">
        <h4>Playing the Game</h4>
        <p>
          After both players have deployed their armies, the game starts with
          the first round and the player that won the deployment roll-off takes
          the first turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their turn, the player picks a unit that has not been activated
          yet, and activates it by performing an action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the action has been taken, their turn ends, and the opposing
          player's turn starts. This continues until all units have activated,
          at which point the round ends and a new one begins. On each new round
          the player that finished activating first on the last round gets to
          activate first.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 4 full rounds have been played the game ends, and players
          determine who won, by checking if they completed their mission
          objectives.

        <h4>Activating Units</h4>
        <p>
          Players must activate one unit that has not been activated yet and
          take one action.
        </p>
        <p>Here are all available actions and what they allow a unit to do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hold - </strong> Doesn't move, can shoot.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance - </strong> Moves 6" and can shoot after moving.

          <li><strong>Charge - </strong> Moves 12" into melee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that Advance, Rush, and Charge actions may sometimes be referred

            total movement distance. Models may never be within 1" of models
            from other units, unless they are taking a Charge action, and may
            never move through other models or units (friendly or enemy), even
            if they are taking a Charge action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that models may also never move outside of the battlefield (no
            part of them, at any point), or be placed in physically impossible
            locations.

          the 1" distance restriction. Units may only take a Charge action if at

          (including any additional movement from special rules).

        <p>
          Note that Charge moves don't have to be in a straight line, and if
          being within charge distance becomes impossible (due to killed models,

        <p>
          If a model is not in coherency with its unit at the beginning of its

        <h4>Picking Targets</h4>
        <p>
          When taking a Charge action, a unit must pick one valid target and all
          models in the unit must charge it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at least one model in the unit is within charge distance of one
          model from the target unit, and has a clear path to reach it, then
          that enemy is a valid target (no line of sight is needed).
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="melee-item no-break">
        <h4>Charge Moves</h4>
        <p>
          Charging models must move by up to 12" to get into base contact with
          an enemy model from the target unit, or as close as possible, whilst
          still maintaining unit coherency (charge moves don't have to be in a
          straight line).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all charging models have moved, all models from the target unit
          that are not in base contact with a charging model must move by up to
          3" to get into base contact with a charging model, or as close as
          possible, maintaining unit coherency.

        <h4>Who Can Strike</h4>
        <p>
          All models that are within 2" horizontally and 4" vertically of an
          enemy model from the target unit, may attack it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Models must strike with all of their melee weapons, and may only
          strike at models from the target unit.

          Melee is done in a simple sequence which has to be followed separately

        <p>

          this melee.

        <h4>Return Strikes</h4>
        <p>
          Once all charging models have attacked, the defending unit may choose
          to strike back (following the melee sequence again), but doesnât have
          to. Note that striking back does not count as its activation, and
          activated units may strike back.
        </p>
        <h4>Fatigue</h4>
        <p>
          After attacking in melee for the first time during a round, either by
          charging or by striking back, units only hit on unmodified rolls of 6
          in melee until the end of that round.
