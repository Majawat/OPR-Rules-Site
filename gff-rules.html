            Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive
            amongst the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
            war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector.
            Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over
            the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a
            Jumpgate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius
            Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of
            war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
            interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic
            engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes
            fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds,
            whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes
            to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
            massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark
            smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities,
            zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to
            foster their own grim ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
            carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising
            commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of
            the Sirius Sector.

          <p>
            Grimdark Future: Firefight is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn
            sci-fi future, which is played using 32mm miniatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game mechanics are designed to be easy to learn but hard to
            master, bringing engaging sci-fi battles for new and experienced
            players alike.
          </p>
          <p>This rulebook is divided into 4 sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Rules</strong> - Everything you need to play the
              game, with plenty of diagrams and examples.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Rules</strong> - Extra rules that you can use on
              top of the basic rules to spice up the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Total Conversions</strong> - Rules that radically modify
              the base rules and provide a new experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional Content</strong> - Extra content that is
              available on our website, added here for your convenience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced
            rules first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game,
            you can then try out the total conversions, which provide a
            radically different experience from the base rules.

        <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
        <p>
          When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
          situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
          right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference
          to resolve the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use
          the following method in the interest of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of
          4-6 player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the
          match, and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer
          details of the rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that whenever possible, players should agree on any rules and
          unusual situations (such as weirdly shaped models) before the game
          begins, to avoid issues later.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
        <p>
          This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind,
          which are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes,
          and we recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they
          come with.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infantry:</strong> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Large Infantry:</strong> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bikes:</strong> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you
          keep base sizes consistent across all models.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Models & Units</h4>
        <p>
          In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
          groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all
          miniatures within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it
          only applies to one individual miniature.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
        <p>
          Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and
          what they can do.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Name [Size]:</strong> The unit name and number of models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality:</strong> The score needed for attacks and morale.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Defense:</strong> The score needed for defense.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equipment:</strong> Any weapons and gear the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Special Rules:</strong> Any special rules the unit has.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost:</strong> How many points it costs to take this unit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Dice</h4>
        <p>
          To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we
          will refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing
          with, we recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you
          can combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
          weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll
          them all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example
          D3, 2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation
          remains the same, so just apply the following explanations to all
          types of weird dice you come across.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>D3:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve
            the result, rounding up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2D6:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum
            the results of both dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>D6+1:</strong> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1
            to the result.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
          number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of
          the second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the
          first. A die roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many
          rules apply to it.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the
          rolloff must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player
          with the highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie
          the players must re-roll until there is a winner.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="general-item no-break">
        <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
        <p>
          During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to
          see if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its
          targets or passing morale tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one
          die. If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts
          as a success, else it counts as a fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
            player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that
            the model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the
            3).</em
