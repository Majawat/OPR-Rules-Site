            Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive
            amongst the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
            war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector.
            Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over
            the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a
            Jumpgate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius
            Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of
            war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
            interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic
            engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes
            fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds,
            whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes
            to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
            massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark
            smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities,
            zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to
            foster their own grim ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
            carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising
            commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of
            the Sirius Sector.
          </p>
          <p>How will you forge your path through this Grimdark Future?</p>
