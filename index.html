      Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive amongst
      the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
      war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector. Looming
      over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over the horizon,
      blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a Jumpgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius Sector.
      A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of war. Here,
      countless battles are constantly fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
      interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic engineering,
      clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes fight bitterly to the
      death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds, whilst
      forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes to wreak
      havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
      massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark smoky
      rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities, zealous
      preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to foster their
      own grim ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
      carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising commanders
      and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of the Sirius
      Sector.

    <p>How will you forge your path through this Grimdark Future?</p>

    <h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>
      Grimdark Future is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn sci-fi future,
      which is played using 32mm miniatures. The game mechanics are designed to
      be easy to learn but hard to master, pinging engaging sci-fi battles for
      new and experienced players alike. This rulebook is divided into 4
      sections:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Basic Rules - Everything you need to play the game, with plenty of
        diagrams and examples.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advanced Rules - Extra rules that you can use on top of the basic rules
        to spice up the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Total Conversions - Rules that radically modify the base rules and
        provide a new experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional Content - Extra content that is available on our website,
        added here for your convenience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced rules
      first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game, you can
      then try out the total conversions, which provide a radically different
      experience from the base rules.

    <h3><a name="generalprinciples">General Principles</a></h3>
    <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
    <p>
      When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
      situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
      right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference to
      resolve the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use the
      following method in the interest of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of 4 6
      player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the match,
      and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer details of
      the rules.
    </p>
    <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
    <p>
      This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind, which
      are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes, and we
      recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they come with.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Infantry:</b> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Large Infantry:</b> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Bikes:</b> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
      <li><b>Monsters:</b> 70mm tall on 60mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Large Walkers:</b> 100mm tall on 120mm oval bases</li>
      <li><b>Vehicles:</b> Various sizes and not mounted on a base</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you keep
      base sizes consistent across all models.
    </p>
    <h4>Models & Units</h4>
    <p>
      In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
      groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all miniatures
      within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it only applies to
      one individual miniature.
    </p>
    <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
    <p>
      Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and what
      they can do.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name (Size):</b> The unit name and number of models</li>
      <li><b>Quality:</b> The score needed for attacks and morale.</li>
      <li><b>Defense:</b> The score needed for defense.</li>
      <li><b>Equipment:</b> Any weapons and gear the unit has.</li>
      <li><b>Special Rules:</b> Any special rules the unit has.</li>
      <li><b>Cost:</b> How many points it costs to take this unit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dice</h4>
    <p>
      To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we will
      refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing with, we
      recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you can
      combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
      weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll them
      all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example D3,
      2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation remains the
      same, so just apply the following explanations to all types of weird dice
      you come across.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>D3:</b> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve the result,
        rounding up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>2D6:</b> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum the results of
        both dice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>D6+1:</b> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1 to the
        result.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
      number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of the
      second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the first. A die
      roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many rules apply to it.
    </p>
    <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the roll
      off must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player with the
      highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie the players
      must re-roll until there is a winner.
    </p>
    <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
    <p>
      During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to see
      if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its targets or
      passing morale tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one die.
      If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts as a
      success, else it counts as a fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
        player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that the
        model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the 3).</em
      >
    </p>
    <h4>Modifiers</h4>
    <p>
      Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers to
      your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a unit's
      roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or subtract
      the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final result,
      however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1 always
      counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with a -1
        modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5, but
        because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h4>Weapons</h4>
    <p>
      All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: ranged weapons
      and melee weapons. Ranged weapons have a range value and can be used for
      shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value and can be used in
      melee.
    </p>
    <p>Weapons profiles are represented like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example: Heavy Rifle (24", A1, AP(1))</em></p>
    <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
    <p>
      To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which you
      may use to measure distances at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model has
      no base, then all distances are measured from its hull or torso, depending
      on the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      When measuring the distance between two models you always measure from/to
      the closest point of their bases.
    </p>
    <p>
      When measuring the distance between two units you always measure from/to
      the closest model in each unit.
    </p>

      src="images/measuring-bases.png"
      alt="learning how to measure between bases"
      width="370"
      height="auto"
    />
    <h4>Measuring Movement</h4>
    <p>
      When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of its
      base moves further than the total distance.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/measuring-movement.png"
      alt="showing incorrect and correct measurement of movement"
      width="370"
      height="auto"
    />
    <p>
      Note that whilst all examples here show round bases, these movement
      restrictions apply in the same way to models on bases of different shape
      or models without a base.
    </p>
    <h4>Line of Sight (LOS)</h4>
    <p>
      When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model can
      see another model for any purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on how strict players want to be with line of sight, they need
      to agree on using one of the following methods before the game begins:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Line of Sight (aka True LoS)</li>
      <li>Top-Down Line of Sight (aka 2D LoS)</li>
      <li>Volumetric Line of Sight (aka 3D LoS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each one of these methods is more complex than the other, and we recommend
      playing with basic line of sight for your first match, and only switch to
      another more complex method if you find it not to be precise enough for
      your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that no matter which method you use, the following rules always apply
      to line of sight:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the
        miniature is actually facing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the
        purpose of line of sight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of
        other units (both friendly or enemy units).
      </li>
      <li>
        Models always have line of sight to themselves, and may target
        themselves (unless stated otherwise).
      </li>
    </ul>
