      Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive amongst
      the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of
      war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector. Looming
      over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over the horizon,
      blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a Jumpgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius Sector.
      A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of war. Here,
      countless battles are constantly fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of
      interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic engineering,
      clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes fight bitterly to the
      death through the wilds of uncharted planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds, whilst
      forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes to wreak
      havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by
      massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark smoky
      rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities, zealous
      preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to foster their
      own grim ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance,
      carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising commanders
      and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of the Sirius
      Sector.

    <h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>
      Grimdark Future is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn sci-fi future,
      which is played using 32mm miniatures. The game mechanics are designed to
      be easy to learn but hard to master, pinging engaging sci-fi battles for
      new and experienced players alike. This rulebook is divided into 4
      sections:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Basic Rules - Everything you need to play the game, with plenty of
        diagrams and examples.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advanced Rules - Extra rules that you can use on top of the basic rules
        to spice up the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Total Conversions - Rules that radically modify the base rules and
        provide a new experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional Content - Extra content that is available on our website,
        added here for your convenience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced rules
      first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game, you can
      then try out the total conversions, which provide a radically different
      experience from the base rules.

    <h3><a name="generalprinciples">General Principles</a></h3>
    <h4>The Most Important Rule</h4>
    <p>
      When playing a complex game there are going to be occasions where a
      situation is not covered by the rules, or a rule does not seem quite
      right. When that is the case use common sense and personal preference to
      resolve the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you and your opponent cannot agree on how to solve a situation, use the
      following method in the interest of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll one die. On a result of 1-3 player A decides, and on a result of 4 6
      player B decides. This decision then applies for the rest of the match,
      and once the game is over you can continue to discuss the finer details of
      the rules.
    </p>
    <h4>Scale Conventions</h4>
    <p>
      This game was written to be played with 32mm scale models in mind, which
      are mounted on round bases. These bases come in various sizes, and we
      recommend that you always mount miniatures on the bases they come with.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some rough guidelines for model and base sizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Infantry:</b> 32mm tall on 20mm/32mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Large Infantry:</b> 50mm tall on 40mm/50mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Bikes:</b> 40mm tall on 60mm oval bases</li>
      <li><b>Monsters:</b> 70mm tall on 60mm round bases</li>
      <li><b>Large Walkers:</b> 100mm tall on 120mm oval bases</li>
      <li><b>Vehicles:</b> Various sizes and not mounted on a base</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the base size that you use doesn't matter, as long as you keep
      base sizes consistent across all models.
    </p>
    <h4>Models & Units</h4>
    <p>
      In the rules, individual miniatures are referred to as models, whilst
      groups of one or more models are referred to as units.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that when a rule applies to a unit it applies to all miniatures
      within that unit, whilst if a rule applies to a model it only applies to
      one individual miniature.
    </p>
    <h4>Unit Stats</h4>
    <p>
      Units come with a variety of statistics that define who they are and what
      they can do.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name (Size):</b> The unit name and number of models</li>
      <li><b>Quality:</b> The score needed for attacks and morale.</li>
      <li><b>Defense:</b> The score needed for defense.</li>
      <li><b>Equipment:</b> Any weapons and gear the unit has.</li>
      <li><b>Special Rules:</b> Any special rules the unit has.</li>
      <li><b>Cost:</b> How many points it costs to take this unit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dice</h4>
    <p>
      To play the game you are going to need some six-sided dice, which we will
      refer to as D6. Depending on how many models you are playing with, we
      recommend having at least 10 to 20 dice to keep things fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we recommend having dice of multiple colors so that you can
      combine them for faster rolling. Whenever a unit is using multiple
      weapons, you can use different colors for each weapon, and then roll them
      all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the rules will refer to different types of dice, for example D3,
      2D6 and D6+1. There are many types of dice, but the notation remains the
      same, so just apply the following explanations to all types of weird dice
      you come across.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>D3:</b> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and halve the result,
        rounding up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>2D6:</b> To use these dice, simply roll two D6 and sum the results of
        both dice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>D6+1:</b> To use these dice, simply roll a D6 and add 1 to the
        result.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Re-Rolls</h4>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule tells you to re-roll a dice result, simply pick up the
      number of dice you have to re-roll, and roll them again. The result of the
      second roll is the final result, even if it's worse than the first. A die
      roll may only be re-rolled once, regardless of how many rules apply to it.
    </p>
    <h4>Roll-Offs</h4>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule tells you to roll-off, all players involved in the roll
      off must roll one die, and then compare their results. The player with the
      highest result wins the roll-off, and in the event of a tie the players
      must re-roll until there is a winner.
    </p>
    <h4>Quality Tests</h4>
    <p>
      During the game you will be required to take Quality tests in order to see
      if a unit succeeds at doing various things such as hitting its targets or
      passing morale tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a rule states that a unit must take a Quality test, roll one die.
      If you score the unit's Quality value or higher, then it counts as a
      success, else it counts as a fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests. The
        player rolls three dice and scores a 3, a 4 and a 5. This means that the
        model gets two successes (the 4 and 5), and one fail (the 3).</em
      >
    </p>
    <h4>Modifiers</h4>
    <p>
      Throughout the game there are going to be rules that apply modifiers to
      your die rolls. These will usually raise or lower the value of a unit's
      roll results by either +1 or -1, but the exact number may vary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, simply add or subtract
      the value from the roll and the new value counts as the final result,
      however a roll of 6 always counts as a success and a roll of 1 always
      counts as a fail, regardless of how much it is being modified by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Example: A model with Quality 4+ must take three Quality tests with a -1
        modifier. The player rolls three dice and scores a 3, 4 and 5, but
        because of the modifier the final result is a 2, a 3 and a 4.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h4>Weapons</h4>
    <p>
      All weapons in the game are separated into two categories: ranged weapons
      and melee weapons. Ranged weapons have a range value and can be used for
      shooting, whilst melee weapons don't have a range value and can be used in
      melee.
    </p>
    <p>Weapons profiles are represented like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name (Range, Attacks, Special Rules)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example: Heavy Rifle (24", A1, AP(1))</em></p>
    <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
    <p>
      To play the game you are going to need a ruler marked in inches, which you
      may use to measure distances at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distances are usually measured from a model's base, however if a model has
      no base, then all distances are measured from its hull or torso, depending
      on the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      When measuring the distance between two models you always measure from/to
      the closest point of their bases.
    </p>
    <p>
      When measuring the distance between two units you always measure from/to
      the closest model in each unit.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/measuring-bases.png"
      alt="learning how to measure between bases"
      width="370"
      height="auto"
    />
    <h4>Measuring Movement</h4>
    <p>
      When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of its
      base moves further than the total distance.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/measuring-movement.png"
      alt="showing incorrect and correct measurement of movement"
      width="370"
      height="auto"
    />
    <p>
      Note that whilst all examples here show round bases, these movement
      restrictions apply in the same way to models on bases of different shape
      or models without a base.
    </p>
    <h4>Line of Sight (LOS)</h4>
    <p>
      When playing the game, line of sight is used to determine if a model can
      see another model for any purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on how strict players want to be with line of sight, they need
      to agree on using one of the following methods before the game begins:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Line of Sight (aka True LoS)</li>
      <li>Top-Down Line of Sight (aka 2D LoS)</li>
      <li>Volumetric Line of Sight (aka 3D LoS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each one of these methods is more complex than the other, and we recommend
      playing with basic line of sight for your first match, and only switch to
      another more complex method if you find it not to be precise enough for
      your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that no matter which method you use, the following rules always apply
      to line of sight:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the
        miniature is actually facing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the
        purpose of line of sight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of
        other units (both friendly or enemy units).
      </li>
      <li>
        Models always have line of sight to themselves, and may target
        themselves (unless stated otherwise).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Basic Line of Sight (aka True LOS)</h4>
    <p>
      When playing with basic line of sight, models can see targets based on the
      actual line of sight of the physical miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine line of sight, simply get down to the eye level of the
      miniature, and check if it can see the target. If the target is visible,
      then the model has line of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using this method, we recommend that models should see at least 10%
      of the target in order to have line of sight, to avoid discussions over
      ambiguous edge cases.
    </p>
    <h4>Top-Down Line of Sight (aka 2D LOS)</h4>
    <p>
      When playing with top-down line of sight, models can see targets by
      drawing lines between their bases, and obstructions block sight based on
      their assigned height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the game begins, players must assign a height value to all units
      and terrain. As a guideline, height can be defined as a value of X+1,
      where X is the actual height of the physical item.
    </p>
    <p><em> Example: A 2” high building counts as being height 3. </em></p>
    <p>
      The same guidelines apply to models, but you can also use the following
      pre-set heights to speed up preparation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Height 1 - Swarms</li>
      <li>Height 2 - Infantry, Artillery</li>
      <li>Height 3 - Large Infantry, Cavalry, Chariots</li>
      <li>Height 4 - Large Cavalry, Monsters, Vehicles</li>
      <li>Height 5 - Large Monsters, Giants</li>
      <li>Height 6 - Titans</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When standing on top of terrain, units add its height to their own, and
      the total counts as their new height value.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Example: A height 2 infantry models standing on a height 3 building
        counts as being height 5.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine line of sight, simply draw a straight line from any point of
      the model's base to any point of the target's base. If the line doesn't
      pass through any obstacles or units of same height or higher than both
      models, then the model has line of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using this method, we recommend counting all models and terrain
      pieces of the same type as being the same height, to avoid having to
      constantly have to measure heights.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/2d-los.png"
      alt="image showing different types of cover amount"
      width="370"
      height="auto"
    />
    <h4>Volumetric Line of Sight (aka 3D LOS)</h4>

    <p>
      When playing with volumetric line of sight, models can see targets by
      drawing lines between imaginary volumes, with heights defined by their
      base sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the game begins, players must assign a height value in inches to
      all units. Each model occupies a volume of space of that height above its
      base, determined by its base size. As a guideline, height can be defined
      based on the typical size of models that are mounted on those base types.
    </p>
    <p>
      For models without a base, measure their actual height and define an area
      around their centre as being their base size for determining how large
      their volume is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst not an exhaustive list, here are some pre-set heights you can use
      to speed up preparation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>25mm Base - Height 1”</li>
      <li>32mm Base - Height 1.25”</li>
      <li>40mm Base - Height 1.5”</li>
      <li>50mm Base - Height 2”</li>
      <li>60mm Base - Height 3”</li>
      <li>100mm Base - Height 4”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To determine line of sight, simply draw a straight line from any point of
      the model's volume to any point of the target model's volume. If the line
      doesn't pass through any obstacles or unit volumes, then the model has
      line of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using this method, we recommend building simple paper cylinders with
      the volume of each base size before playing, which can be used during the
      game in place of models to determine line of sight more easily.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="preparation">Preparation</a></h3>
    <h4>Preparing the Battlefield</h4>
    <p>
      You are going to need a flat 6'x4' area to play on, which is usually
      referred to as “the battlefield” or “the table”. Note that the game can be
      also played on smaller areas, as long as armies deploy at least 24" apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst we recommend playing on a table, you can of course play on the
      floor, on a bed, or wherever else you have space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have found a space to play, you are going to have to place at
      least 15 pieces of terrain on it, though we recommend using 20 or more to
      keep things interesting. Whilst it's always nice to play with great
      looking pieces of terrain, you can simply use household items such as
      books or cups as terrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no specific rules on how you should place terrain, but we have
      provided some general guidelines in the terrain section of this book to
      help you get started.
    </p>
    <h4>Placing Objectives</h4>
    <p>
      After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up D3+2
      objective markers on the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first objective
      marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker each outside of
      the deployment zones, and over 9” away from other markers (note that
      markers can't be placed in unreachable position, like impassable terrain).
    </p>
    <h4>The Mission</h4>
    <p>
      At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3” of a marker whilst no
      enemies are, then it counts as being seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markers remain seized even if the unit moves away, but if units from both
      sides contest a marker at the end of a round, then it becomes neutral
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 4 rounds have been played, the game ends, and the player that
      controls most markers wins.
    </p>
    <h4>Preparing Your Army</h4>
    <p>
      Before the game begins, you and your opponent are going to have to agree
      on what size of game you want to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a start we recommend playing with armies worth 1000pts each, and once
      you have gotten familiar with the game, you can start playing full matches
      with 2000pts armies each.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put your army together, simply select units and upgrades from your
      army's list, and sum together their total point cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no limitations as to how many units you can take, as long as
      their total point cost doesn't go over the agreed limit.
    </p>
    <h4>Force Organisation <small>(optional)</small></h4>
    <p>
      Optionally you and your opponent may agree to use the force organisation
      rules, which help make army composition more consistent and balanced.
    </p>
    <p>The armies must follow these limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 1 hero per 500pts</li>
      <li>
        Only 1+X copies of the same unit, where X is 1 per 1000pts (combined
        units count as one)
      </li>
      <li>No single unit worth over 35% of total points</li>
      <li>Only 1 unit per 200pts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em
        >Example: When playing a 2000pts game, players may bring max. 4 heroes,
        max. 3 copies of each unit, no unit worth over 700pts, and max. 10 units
        in total.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h4>Combined Units</h4>
    <p>
      When preparing your army, you may combine two copies of the same
      multi-model into a single big unit, as long as any upgrades that are
      applied to all models are bought for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Example: A unit of Dynasty Warriors with Rifles cannot be merged with a
        unit of Dynasty Warriors with Shotguns, because they have two different
        upgrades that are applied to all models in the unit.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h4>Deploying Armies</h4>
    <p>
      Once the mission has been set up, the players roll-off and the winner must
      start deploying their army first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winning player first chooses one long table edge to deploy on and then
      places one unit fully within 12” of their table edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once they are done, then the opposing player places one unit fully within
      12” of the opposite table edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the players continue alternating in placing one unit each, until all
      units have been deployed.
