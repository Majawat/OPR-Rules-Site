    <h1>Beginner's Guide</h1>
    <h2>v3.3.0</h2>
    <p>Lost in a galaxy far from our own, humanity struggles to survive amongst the stars.</p>Earth is but a distant memory for those beneath the grim tapestry of war-torn worlds that form the new constellations of this sector. Looming over them, massive fleets of spaceborne vessels creep over the horizon, blocking out the stars as they slowly approach a Jumpgate.</p>
        Beyond this gate, lies the violence and beauty of the wider Sirius Sector. A myriad of systems, none left untouched by the ravages of war. Here, countless battles are constantly fought.</p>
        Bullets hiss across once lush worlds stripped bare by the greed of interstellar industry. Serrated claws, honed through genetic engineering, clash against energized plasma blades, as old foes fight bitterly to the death through the wilds of uncharted planets.</p>
        Matter is bent and shaped according to the will of powerful minds, whilst forces beyond mortal understanding pour forth from wormholes to wreak havoc and destruction on poor unsuspecting souls.</p>
        Vital trade routes are contested along the edge of remote systems by massive battle fleets, while the sector's fate is meted out in dark smoky rooms by political envoys. On the streets of mega cities, zealous preachers and visionaries call out to the masses, hoping to foster their own grim ambitions.</p>
        As all this unfolds, dispassionate eyes watch on from a distance, carefully considering the outcome of each clash, as promising commanders and leaders rise and fall throughout the battlefields of the Sirius Sector.</p>
        How will you forge your path through this Grimdark Future?</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Grimdark Future is a miniature wargame set in a war-torn sci-fi future, which is played using 32mm miniatures.</p>
        The game mechanics are designed to be easy to learn but hard to master, pinging engaging sci-fi battles for new and experienced players alike. </p>
        This rulebook is divided into 4 sections:
        <ul><li>Basic Rules - Everything you need to play the game, with
        plenty of diagrams and examples.</li>
            <li>Advanced Rules - Extra rules that you can use on top of
        the basic rules to spice up the game.</li>
            <li>Total Conversions - Rules that radically modify the base
        rules and provide a new experience.</li>
            <li>Additional Content - Extra content that is available on
        our website, added here for your convenience.</li></ul>
        <p>We recommend that you start off by playing with just a few advanced rules first, and then gradually add more as you get more comfortable with them.</p>
        <p>Once you feel like you've gained a good understanding of the game, you can then try out the total conversions, which provide a radically different experience from the base rules.</p>
